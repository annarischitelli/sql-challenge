SQL-challenge

In this assignment, I designed the tables in SQL to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. There were two main components to this assignment:
    1. Data Engineering
    2. Data Analysis

Project steps:
- I started by mapping my database using QuickDB design. The PNG file is in the repo.
- Next I created the tables in SQL to hold my data. The table designs, PKs, and FKs, matched my initial DB design.
- I imported the CSV data into my SQl tables.
- I completed various data analysis question on the data set using SQl queries and functions.
